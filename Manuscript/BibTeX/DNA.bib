  abstract = {CASSCF and CAS-PT2 calculations are performed for the ground and excited
	states of radical cations consisting of two and three nucleobases.
	The generalized Mulliken-Hush approach is employed for estimating
	electronic couplings for hole transfer in the -stacks. We compare
	the CASSCF results with data obtained within Koopmans' approximation.
	The calculations show that an excess charge in the ground and excited
	states in the systems is quite localized on a single base both at
	the CASSCF level and in Koopmans' picture. However, the CASSCF calculations
	point to a larger degree of localization and, in line with this,
	smaller transition dipole moments. The agreement between the CAS-PT2
	corrected energy gaps and the values estimated with Koopmans' theorem
	is better, with the CAS-PT2 calculations giving somewhat smaller
	gaps. Overall, both factors result in smaller CASSCF/CAS-PT2 couplings,
	which are reduced by up to 40% of the couplings calculated using
	Koopmans' approximation. The tabulated data can be used as benchmark
	values for the electronic couplings of stacked nucleobases. For the
	base trimers, comparison of the results obtained within two- and
	three-state models show that the multistate treatment should be applied
	to derive reliable estimates. Finally, the superexchange approach
	to estimate the donor acceptor electronic coupling in the stacks
	GAG and GTG is considered.},

  abstract = {Molecular dynamics (MD) simulations including water and counterions
	on B-DNA oligomers containing all 136 unique tetranucleotide basepair
	steps are reported. The objective is to obtain the calculated dynamical
	structure for at least two copies of each case, use the results to
	examine issues with regard to convergence and dynamical stability
	of MD on DNA, and determine the significance of sequence context
	effects on all unique dinucleotide steps. This information is essential
	to understand sequence effects on DNA structure and has implications
	on diverse problems in the structural biology of DNA. Calculations
	were carried out on the 136 cases embedded in 39 DNA oligomers with
	repeating tetranucleotide sequences, capped on both ends by GC pairs
	and each having a total length of 15 nucleotide pairs. All simulations
	were carried out using a well-defined state-of-the-art MD protocol,
	the AMBER suite of programs, and the parm94 force field. In a previous
	article (Beveridge et al. 2004. Biophysical Journal. 87:3799-3813),
	the research design, details of the simulation protocol, and informatics
	issues were described. Preliminary results from 15 ns MD trajectories
	were presented for the d(CpG) step in all 10 unique sequence contexts.
	The results indicated the sequence context effects to be small for
	this step, but revealed that MD on DNA at this length of trajectory
	is subject to surprisingly persistent cooperative transitions of
	the sugar-phosphate backbone torsion angles alpha and gamma. In this
	article, we report detailed analysis of the entire trajectory database
	and occurrence of various conformational substates and its impact
	on studies of context effects. The analysis reveals a possible direct
	correspondence between the sequence-dependent dynamical tendencies
	of DNA structure and the tendency to undergo transitions that "trap"
	them in nonstandard conformational substates. The difference in mean
	of the observed basepair step helicoidal parameter distribution with
	different flanking sequence sometimes differs by as much as one standard
	deviation, indicating that the extent of sequence effects could be
	significant. The observations reveal that the impact of a flexible
	dinucleotide such as CpG could extend beyond the immediate basepair
	neighbors. The results in general provide new insight into MD on
	DNA and the sequence-dependent dynamical structural characteristics
	of DNA.},

  abstract = {Zinc ions are frequently found in DNA-binding proteins. p53 is a cancer-related
	transcriptional factor, and its DNA-binding domain (DBD) contains
	a Zn2+, which has been shown to be important for aggregation and
	sequence-specific DNA binding. We have carried out molecular dynamics
	simulations to investigate the influence of Zn2+ on the p53 DNA recognition
	and the stability of the DBD. In the simulation with Zn2+ present,
	the protein attracted to the DNA phosphate backbone, allowing for
	Arg248 on loop L3 to be inserted into the minor groove for specific
	contact with the DNA base. The insertion of Arg248 between the backbone
	phosphate groups in the minor groove caused a narrowing of the minor
	groove, which is not seen in the simulation without Zn2+. Structurally,
	the zinc ion coordinated the motions among the different protein
	structural elements, which could also be important for optimal binding
	and core packing. The influence of Zn2+ on protein stability was
	mainly localized to the L2 loop. Our results suggest that L2 may
	be a frustrated and highly flexible element and play an important
	role in aggregation of Zn-free p53. Zn2+ keeps the L2 structured
	and probably prevents aggregation.},

	a transfer-matrix treatment, within an electronic tight-binding Hamiltonian
	model, suitable to describe the DNA segments modelled by the quasiperiodic
	chains. We compared the DOS spectra found for the quasiperiodic structure
	to those using a sequence of natural DNA, as part of the human chromosome
	Ch22, with a remarkable concordance, as far as the RS structure is
	concerned. The electronic spectrum shows several peaks, corresponding
