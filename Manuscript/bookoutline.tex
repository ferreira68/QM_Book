\chapter*{Preface}


This is an attempt to start collecting the ideas for each chapter and what we may need.  It serves as an organization of ideas mostly.  It is also a good way for me to relearn to use TeX and the software again.  I can use the practice.

I assume that best way to proceed will to make each chapter a different file and work on them separately.  In fact on the publisher's web page of instructions they want each chapter as a separate file it looks like.  We could divide them to do the first drafts.  One start would be: Tony - 4,5; Henry - 2,3.  We should talk a bit more about 1, 6, and 7.  The sections are based on what was in the proposal and I expect they will change a lot as it goes.

% NOTE: Henry, you need to add the bookrefs.bib file to the CVS repository
%       with the "cvs add bookrefs.bib" command, followed by a "cvs commit"
%       to make sure it gets into the repository.  My compilations only get
%       the references in the DNA.bib file.  We can use as many .bib files
%       as we like (see the new command below).
