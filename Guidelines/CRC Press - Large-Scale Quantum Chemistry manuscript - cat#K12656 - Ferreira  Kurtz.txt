Drs. Ferreira and Kurtz, 

 

Congratulations on your upcoming book project with Taylor & Francis. My name is David Fausel and I am the project coordinator assigned to your manuscript, Large-Scale Quantum Chemistry: A Practical Guide for Electronic Structure Calculations.  I’m looking forward to working with you! 

 

I work directly with Lance Wobus and will be your main contact for any questions regarding our submission requirements, Copyright Permissions, and your final submission. Any questions or concerns regarding the terms of your contract, marketing, content, or promoting your book, etc., should continue to be directed to your acquiring editor directly. 

 

To begin the process of getting you started on your manuscript, here is a quick timeline on the submission process and some further details:

 

·        Sample chapters (including artwork) are due to my attention by 6/1/11 so that I may confirm that you are on the right track with preparing your chapters. 

·        Your final and complete manuscript is due on 6/1/12.

·        All permissions materials are due on 6/1/12 with your manuscript submission. Please see below for more details on permissions. 

·        The number of double spaced pages in your manuscript should be 240. The typical production schedule for a book this size is approximately six months from the date it arrives in our production department. You will be advised of the production schedule and anticipated publication date at that time.

 

When I am ready to submit, what is the process? 

You will submit your final manuscript and materials directly to my attention at the address below. Upon receipt I will be reviewing the files in preparation to transfer it onto our production department to begin the publication process. When it is a bit closer to your final submission date, I will provide you with a checklist and details for your final submission. If you would like to receive this information earlier in the process, please let me know.

 

What if I am running behind or have a change to my contracted page count?

If you have changes in page count or delays in submission, please let me and your Acquiring Editor know immediately as pricing, Amazon, our website, and marketing and production schedules will need to be adjusted accordingly. 

 

Are there specific guidelines I need to follow for my manuscript?

Yes, we do have specific requirements for your text and artwork and I have attached copies of these here. Please read through these documents carefully as they contain crucial information on all of our software and submission requirements. Some main points to remember:

 

·         Do not format the chapters; we will do all typesetting and layout as part of the production process. 

·        The text must be provided electronically in Microsoft Word or another acceptable software format (please see attached Author Guidelines for more information). 

·        All artwork should be in electronic format in individual files labeled by chapter/figure number (i.e. Fig 1.3, etc. Do not use section numbering such as Fig 1.3.5, etc.). This includes chemical structures. Do not place artwork within your text. We will do this for you as part of the production process.  

·        We copyedit according to the Chicago Manual of Style, 15th edition for punctuation, spelling, grammar, and sentence structure only – you will need to verify the content, equations, tables, figures. If you have used a different style that must be retained, please let me know immediately.  

·        All units should be provided in SI Units as we have a very international readership. 

 

Do I need to worry about Copyright Permissions right now or can I wait until later in the process?  

You should begin requesting any necessary permissions now. Your book cannot be released to the printer until all have been received and your book will be placed on hold in production if these do not arrive in a timely manner.  Your completed PV form (attached) and all grants should accompany your manuscript submission. Should requested grants still be pending, please include copies of your requests. We can allow an additional month for these to be submitted as long as we have received a copy of the request within this timeframe. Should permissions not be secured or requested by this time, they will be submitted to an outside service for completion and we reserve the right to charge all subsequent costs to your Author’s Royalty account. 

 

How do we know what requires permission? 

The attached Copyright Permission FAQ sheet will assist you with common questions on copyright permissions and will provide more details on the process of making your permission requests. Please feel free to contact me at any time with any additional questions. 

 

This should cover the initial points to get you started. We will be in touch continuously throughout the process to discuss your progress and any questions that you may have. Please do acknowledge receipt of this email so that I know my email has gone through successfully and there are no troubles with the email filters. 

 

I am happy to be working with you and look forward to hearing from you soon.  

 

Thanks very much!

 

Best,

David
