abstract = {Protein-DNA interactions play a central role in regulatory processes at the genetic level. DNA-binding proteins recognize their targets by direct base-amino acid interactions and indirect conformational energy contribution from DNA deformations and elasticity. Knowledge-based approach based on the statistical analysis of protein-DNA complex structures has been successfully used to calculate interaction energies and specificities of direct and indirect readouts in protein-DNA recognition. Here, we have implemented the method as a webserver, which calculates direct and indirect readout energies and Z-scores, as a measure of specificity, using atomic coordinates of protein-DNA complexes. This server is freely available at http://gibk26.bse.kyutech.ac.jp/jouhou/readout/. The only input to this webserver is the Protein Data Bank (PDB) style coordinate data of atoms or the PDB code itself. The server returns total energy Z-scores, which estimate the degree of sequence specificity of the protein-DNA complex. This webserver is expected to be useful for estimating interaction energy and DNA conformation energy, and relative contributions to the specificity from direct and indirect readout. It may also be useful for checking the quality of protein-DNA complex structures, and for engineering proteins and target DNAs.},

abstract = {If any proof were needed of DNA's versatile roles and use, it is certainly provided by the numerous depositions of new three-dimensional (3D) structures to the coordinate databanks (PDB, NDB) over the last two years. Quadruplex motifs involving G-repeats, adducted sequences and oligo-2'-deoxynucleotides (ODNs) with bound ligands are particularly well represented. In addition, structures of chemically modified DNAs (CNAs) and artificial analogs are yielding insight into stability, pairing properties, and dynamics, including those of the native nucleic acids. Besides being of significance for establishing diagnostic tools and in the analysis of protein-DNA interactions, chemical modification in conjunction with investigations of the structural consequences may yield novel nucleic acid-based therapeutics. DNA's predictable and highly specific pairing behavior makes it the material of choice for constructing 3D-nanostructures of defined architecture. Recently the first examples of DNA nanoparticle and self-assembled 3D-crystals were reported. Although the structures discussed in this review are all based either on X-ray crystallography or solution NMR, small angle X-ray scattering (SAXS), and cryoEM are proving to be useful approaches for the characterization of nanoscale DNA architecture.},

abstract = {High level quantum mechanical methods were used to study the intercalation
complexes of psoralen and 8-methoxy psoralen with DNA. The energetics,
structures and properties of isolated psoralen and 8-methoxy psoralen
have been investigated. Their interactions with DNA bases and base
pair were studied aiming to understand more about the nature of the
intercalation binding forces between these intercalators and DNA.
The geometry of adducts of psoralens with adenine and thymine as
well as adenine-thymine base pair have been optimized in two main
orientations, planar and stacked, by means of HF, DFT and MP2 levels
of computation employing different basis sets. The different computational
methods have been compared and the effect of the basis set has been
discussed. The potential energy surface of the psoralen adducts with
DNA-bases and base pair was explored and the global minimum was located
for the planar adducts. The interaction energy [Delta]E was corrected
for the basis set superposition error with the full counterpoise
(CP) method, resulting in a more reliable estimation of the interaction
energy. More reliable estimates of the interaction energy have been
calculated using coupled-cluster methods (CCSD(T)). Effect of vertical
distance and rotational angle between the stacked molecules on the
interaction energy were investigated by the above three methods.
Only, the MP2 method was shown to be valid for studying intercalation
complexes. We found that, of the binding forces, charge transfer
and dispersion play an important role with the latter predominating
in our investigated systems. Ab initio methods which account for
the electron correlation effects are the minimum level for studying
the non-covalent interactions.},

abstract = {A complete scan of the potential-energy surfaces for selected DNA base trimers has been performed by a molecular dynamics/quenching technique using the force field of Cornell et al. implemented in the AMBER7 program. The resulting most stable/populated structures were then reoptimized at a correlated ab initio level by employing resolution of the identity, M\o ller-Plesset second-order perturbation theory (RI-MP2). A systematic study of these trimers at such a complete level of electronic structure theory is presented for the first time. We show that prior experimental and theoretical interpretations were incorrect in assuming that the most stable structures of the methylated trimers corresponded to planar systems characterized by cyclic intermolecular hydrogen bonding. We found that stacked structures of two bases with the third base in a T-shape arrangement are the global minima in all of the methylated systems: they are more stable than the cyclic planar structures by about 10 kcal mol(-1). The different behaviors of nonmethylated and methylated trimers is also discussed. The high-level geometries and interaction energies computed for the trimers serve also as a reference for the testing of recently developed density functional theory (DFT) functionals with respect to their ability to correctly describe the balance between the electrostatic and dispersion contributions that bind these trimers together. The recently reported M052X functional with a polarized triple-zeta basis set predicts 11 uracil trimer interaction energies with a root-mean-square error of 2.3 kcal mol(-1) relative to highly correlated ab initio theoretical calculations.},

abstract = {The relative energies of the energetically low-lying tautomers of pyridone, cytosine, uracil, thymine, guanine, and iso-cytosine are studied by a variety of different quantum chemical methods. In particular, we employ density functional theory (DFT) using the six functionals HCTH407, PBE, BP86, B-LYP, B3-LYP, and BH-LYP, and the ab initio methods Hartree-Fock (HF), standard second-order M ller-Plesset perturbation theory (MP2), an improved version of it (SCS-MP2), and quadratic configuration interaction including single and double excitations (QCISD) and perturbative triple corrections QCISD(T). A detailed basis set study is performed for the formamide/formamidic acid tautomeric pair. In general, large AO basis sets of at least valence triple-zeta quality including f-functions (TZV) are employed, which are found to be necessary for an accurate energetic description of the various structures. The performance of the more approximate methods is evaluated with QCISD(T)/TZV(2df,2dp) data taken as reference. In general it is found that DFT is not an appropriate method for the problem. For the tautomers of pyridone and cytosine, most density functionals, including the popular B3-LYP hybrid, predict a wrong energetic order, and only for guanine, the correct sequence of tautomers is obtained with all functionals. Out of the density functionals tested, BH-LYP, which includes a rather large fraction of HF exchange, performs best. A consistent description of the nonaromatic versus aromatic tautomers seems to be a general problem especially for pure, nonhybrid functionals. Tentatively, this could be assigned to the exchange potentials used while the functional itself, including the correlation part, seems to be appropriate. Out of the ab initio methods tested, the new SCS-MP2 approach seems to perform best because it effectively reduces some outliers obtained with standard MP2. It outperforms the much more costly QCISD method and seems to be a very good compromise between computational effort and accuracy.},

@article{Roginskaya2004a,
abstract = {In this study we report analytical solutions for both time-dependent and steady-state problems of unbiased charge transfer through a regular DNA sequence via a hopping mechanism. The phenomenon is treated as a diffusion of charge in a one-dimensional array of equally spaced and energetically equivalent temporary trapping sites. The solutions take into account the rates of charge hopping (k), side reactions (k(r)), and charge transfer to a terminal charge acceptor (k(t)). A detailed analysis of the time-dependent problem is performed for the diffusion-controlled regime, i.e., under the assumption that k(t) >> k, which is also equivalent to the fast relaxation limit of charge trapping. The analysis shows that the kinetics of charge hopping through DNA is always multiexponential, but under certain circumstances it can be asymptotically approximated by a single-exponential term. In that case, the efficiency of charge transfer can be characterized by a single rate constant k(CT) = 1.23kN(-2) + k(r), where N is the DNA length expressed in terms of the number of equidistant trapping sites and k(r) is the rate of competing chemical processes. The absolute yield of charge transfer under steady-state conditions in general is obtained as Y(infinity) = omega [alpha sinh(alphaN) + omega cosh(alphaN)](-1), where alpha = (2k(r)/k)(1/2) and omega = 2k(t)/k. For the diffusion-controlled regime and small N, in particular, it turns into the known "algebraic" dependence Y(infinity) = [1 + (k(r)/k)N(2)](-1). At large N the solution is asymptotically exponential with the parameter alpha mimicking the tunneling parameter beta in agreement with earlier predictions. Similar equations and distance dependencies have also been obtained for the damage ratios at the intermediate and terminal trapping sites in DNA. The nonlinear least-squares fit of one of these equations to experimental yields of guanine oxidation available from the literature returns kinetic parameters that are in reasonable agreement with those obtained by Bixon et al. [Proc. Natl. Acad. Sci. U.S.A.1999, 96, 11713-11716] by numerical simulations, suggesting that these two approaches are physically equivalent.},

The binding of ligands to DNA changes the overall mechanic response of the dsDNA molecule.

Binding of molecules to the minor and major groove of dsDNA induces distinct changes in the molecular elasticity compared to the free dsDNA detectable as a shift of the overstretching transition to higher forces. Intercalating molecules affect the molecular mechanics by a complete disappearance of the B-S transition and an associated increase in molecular contour length. Significant force hysteresis effects occurring during stretching/relaxation cycles with velocities >10 nm/s for YOYO-1 and >1000 nm/s for daunomycin. These indicate structural changes in the timescale of minutes for the YOYO-DNA and of seconds for the daunomycin-DNA complexes, respectively.},

abstract = {The zinc finger domain of the Wilms tumor suppressor protein (WT1) contains four canonical Cys(2)His(2) zinc fingers. WT1 binds preferentially to DNA sequences that are closely related to the EGR-1 consensus site. We report the structure determination by both X-ray crystallography and NMR spectroscopy of the WT1 zinc finger domain in complex with DNA. The X-ray structure was determined for the complex with a cognate 14 base-pair oligonucleotide, and composite X-ray/NMR structures were determined for complexes with both the 14 base-pair and an extended 17 base-pair DNA. This combined approach allowed unambiguous determination of the position of the first zinc finger, which is influenced by lattice contacts in the crystal structure. The crystal structure shows the second, third and fourth zinc finger domains inserted deep into the major groove of the DNA where they make base-specific interactions. The DNA duplex is distorted in the vicinity of the first zinc finger, with a cytidine twisted and tilted out of the base stack to pack against finger 1 and the tip of finger 2. By contrast, the composite X-ray/NMR structures show that finger 1 continues to follow the major groove in the solution complexes. However, the orientation of the helix is non-canonical, and the fingertip and the N terminus of the helix project out of the major groove; as a consequence, the zinc finger side-chains that are commonly involved in base recognition make no contact with the DNA. We conclude that finger 1 helps to anchor WT1 to the DNA by amplifying the binding affinity although it does not contribute significantly to binding specificity. The structures provide molecular level insights into the potential consequences of mutations in zinc fingers 2 and 3 that are associated with Denys-Drash syndrome and nephritic syndrome. The mutations are of two types, and either destabilize the zinc finger structure or replace key base contact residues.},

The simulation shows ubiquitous presence of up to five CSBWs along the minor groove, each with residence time ranging from 400 ps to 750 ps. The molecular orbitals localized on these CSBWs are nearly degenerate in energy with the highest occupied molecular orbital of DNA localized on guanine bases, strongly indicating that the hole transport along the guanines is mediated by the ubiquitous CSBWs.},

abstract = {Properties of isolated intercalators (ethidium (E), daunomycin (D), ellipticine (EL), and 4,6'-diaminide-2-phenylindole (DAPI)) and their stacking interactions with adenine···thymine (AT) and guanine···cytosine (GC) nucleic acid base pairs were investigated by means of a nonempirical correlated ab initio method. All intercalators exhibit large charge delocalization, and none of them (including the DAPI dication) exhibits a site with dominant charge. All intercalators have large polarizability and are good electron acceptors, while base pairs are good electron donors. MP2/6-31G*(0.25) stabilization energies of intercalator···base pair complexes are large (E···AT, 22.4 kcal/mol; D···GC, 17.8 kcal/mol; EL···GC, 18.2 kcal/mol; DAPI···GC, 21.1 kcal/mol) and are well reproduced by modified AMBER potential (van der Waals radii of intercalator atoms are enlarged and their energy depths are increased). Standard AMBER potential underestimates binding, especially for DAPI-containing complexes. Because the DAPI dication is the best electron acceptor (among all intercalators studied), this difference is explained by the importance of the charge-transfer term, which is not included in the AMBER potential. For the neutral EL molecule, the standard AMBER force field provides correct results. The Hartree-Fock and DFT/B3LYP methods, not covering the dispersion energy, fail completely to reveal any energy minimum at the potential energy curve of the E···AT complex, and these methods thus cannot be recommended for a study of intercalation process. On the other hand, an approximate version of the DFT method, which was extended to cover London dispersion energy, yields for all complexes very good stabilization energies that are well comparable with referenced ab initio data. Besides the vertical dependence of the interaction, an energy twist dependence of the interaction energy was also investigated by a reference correlated ab initio method and empirical potentials. It is concluded that, despite the cationic (E +1, D +1, DAPI +2) or polar (EL) character of the intercalators investigated, it is the dispersion energy which predominantly contributes to the stability of intercalator···DNA base pair complexes. Any procedure which does not cover dispersion energy is thus not suitable for studying the process of intercalation.},

abstract = {Interactions of DNA bases represent a crucial source of DNA conformational
variability. Oligonucleotide crystal studies revealed a number of
base-base interactions which seem to be stabilized by nonplanar DNA
base amino groups. Therefore, an accurate description of the geometry
and deformability of the DNA base amino groups is very important.
Here, the second-order Maller-Plesset (MP2) 6-3 1 G*-optimized nonplanar
geometries of adenine, cytosine, guanine, thymine, and isocytosine
are presented. The amino groups of the bases exhibit significant
sp3 pyramidalization. The dihedral angles between the cytosine and
adenine rings and their amino group hydrogen atoms range from 10
to 25O, and the nonplanar cytosine and adenine are 0.4 kcal/mol more
stable than the planar molecules. Dihedral angles between the two
guanine amino group hydrogen atoms and the guanine ring are 43 and
12O, and the nonplanar guanine is 1.6 kcal/mol more stable than the
planar molecule. Isocytosine exhibits amino group properties similar
to those of guanine. Selected DNA bases were also optimized using
larger basis sets of atomic orbitals: 6-31G**, DZP+, and DZ(2d).
The MP2/6-31G** calculations yield results very similar to those
of the MP2/6-3 lG* calculations, while the larger DZP+ and DZ(2d)
basis sets indicate an even greater amino group nonplanarity.},

abstract = {Hydrogen-bonded nucleic acids base pairs substantially contribute
to the structure and stability of nucleic acids. The study presents
reference ab initio structures and interaction energies of selected
base pairs with binding energies ranging from -5 to -47 kcal/mol.
The molecular structures are obtained using the RI-MP2 (resolution
of identity MP2) method with extended cc-pVTZ basis set of atomic
orbitals. The RI-MP2 method provides results essentially identical
with the standard MP2 method. The interaction energies are calculated
using the Complete Basis Set (CBS) extrapolation at the RI-MP2 level.
For some base pairs, Coupled-Cluster corrections with inclusion of
noniterative triple contributions (CCSD(T)) are given. The calculations
are compared with selected medium quality methods. The PW91 DFT functional
with the 6-31G** basis set matches well the RI-MP2/CBS absolute interaction
energies and reproduces the relative values of base pairing energies
with a maximum relative error of 2.6 kcal/mol when applied with Becke3LYP-optimized
geometries. The Becke3LYP DFT functional underestimates the interaction
energies by few kcal/mol with relative error of 2.2 kcal/mol. Very
good performance of nonpolarizable Cornell et al. force field is
confirmed and this indirectly supports the view that H-bonded base
pairs are primarily stabilized by electrostatic interactions.},

abstract = {Due to the presence of the 2'-OH hydroxyl group of ribose, RNA molecules utilize an astonishing variability of base pairing patterns to build up their structures and perform the biological functions. Many of the key RNA base pairing families have no counterparts in DNA. In this study, the trans Watson-Crick/sugar edge (trans WC/SE) RNA base pair family has been characterized using quantum chemical and molecular mechanics calculations. Gas-phase optimized geometries from density functional theory (DFT) calculations and RIMP2 interaction energies are reported for the 10 crystallographically identified trans WC/SE base pairing patterns. Further, stable structures are predicted for all of the remaining six possible members of this family not seen in RNAs so far. Among these novel six base pairs, the computations substantially refine two structures suggested earlier based on simple isosteric considerations. For two additional trans WC/SE base pairs predicted in this study, no arrangement was suggested before. Thus, our study brings a complete set of trans WC/SE base pairing patterns. The present results are also contrasted with calculations reported recently for the cis WC/SE base pair family. The computed base pair sizes are in sound correlation with the X-ray data for all WC/SE pairing patterns including both their cis and trans isomers. This confirms that the isostericity of RNA base pairs, which is one of the key factors determining the RNA sequence conservation patterns, originates in the properties of the isolated base pairs. In contrast to the cis structures, however, the isosteric subgroups of the trans WC/SE family differ not only in their H-bonding patterns and steric dimensions but also in the intrinsic strength of the intermolecular interactions. The distribution of the total interaction energy over the sugar-base and base-base contributions is controlled by the cis-trans isomerism.},
